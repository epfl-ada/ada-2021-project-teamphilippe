# Project : Milestone 2

## Abstract
These days, machine learning and data are more and more used to make decisions and studies. To avoid making 
discriminatory decisions against certain group of people or draw negatively influenced results, it is therefore crucial that people using these data are 
aware of the potential biases in the data.


The goal is to shed light on the hidden biases of the dataset that can greatly influence the results of a study
that would use this dataset to train, e.g. ML models or compute statistics. In particular, the biases we want to
investigate are related to :
- Sex of the author
- Origin of the author
- Age of the author


## Research Questions
For each of the above cited characterization of people, we would like to answer the following questions :
- Are these groups of people equally represented in the dataset ? (Exploratory data analyis)
- Do the sentiments in quotes of certain groups of are rather negative or positive and how does that 
evolve over time ?
- Among the quotes talking about someone else, do these quotes are rather positive or negative compared to the 
  belonging of the other and the person in the quote ? (Can use a library called spaCy which is a Named Entity Recognition
  tool, see here https://towardsdatascience.com/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da)
